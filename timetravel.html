    <h3>Design Problem</h3>

    <p>Design two key screens for a time travel app, including a small icon set. Create two personas and build a solution off of that.</p>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Discipline: Interaction Design</li>
      <li>Platforms: Mobile</li>
      <li>Tools Used: Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h3>Approach</h3>

    <p>To solve for this design problem, I began by drafting <strong>research questions</strong> and conducting virtual stakeholder interviews to identify user needs. From there, I crafted <strong>user personas</strong> and did some quick <strong>sketches</strong>. Finally, I was able to align on a core set of features by building <strong>wireframes</strong>, that ultimately went on to inform the <strong>style guide</strong> and <strong>high-fidelity screens</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <h4>Research Questions</h4>

    <p>I crafted high level research questions for the stakeholder interviews in order to gather attitudinal, behavorial, and characteristic information.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attitudinal:</li>
      <li>How do people feel about time travel?
      <li>What are their thoughts on products that could facilitate time travel?
      <li>Behavioral:
      <li>Why and how do people currently travel and what are their pain points?
      <li>Characteristic:
      <li>Who would benefit from a time machine product?
      <li>Who are the stakeholders of this product?
    </ul>

    <h4>Interview Questions</h4>

    <p>From the high level research questions, individual interview questions were drafted. These questions ladder up to the attitudinal, behavorial, and characteristic information that will go on to inform the personas.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attitudinal:</li>
      <li>“What do you see as the main benefits or negative consequences of time travel?”</li>
      <li>“If you could wave a magic wand what would the act of time travel look like to you?”</li>
      <li>Behavioral:</li>
      <li>“What are important considerations when preparing to travel to a different location in real life right now?”</li>
      <li>Characteristic:</li>
      <li>“If you were able to time travel, what would you do, when in time would you travel to? What are your motivations or goals?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Stakeholder Personas</h4>

    <p>Despite the pandemic, I was able to conduct two user interviews, albeit remotely. I distilled all of the interviews and findings into two personas. I decided to focus on the motivations and obstacles that people may experience while shopping or managing a small business.</p>

    <h3>Design</h3>

    <h4>Sketches</h4>

    <p>Sketching basic wireframes of the core screens and components was the step in the design process. I sketched a few variations of each screen in order to document some basic concepts and layouts. I also sketched some icons that would go on to be used in the final high fidelity screens. </p>

    <figcaption>Alternate Sketches</figcaption>

    <figcaption>Icon Sketches</figcaption>

    <h4>Wireframes</h4>

    <p>I replicated the sketches as wireframes with a few minor adjustments.</p>

    <figcaption>Wireframes</figcaption>

    <h3>Visual Design</h3>

    <h4>Inspiration</h4>

    <p>I pulled inspiration from mobile and tablet websites and applictions. This visual mood board served as a starting point for developing the style guide.</p>

    <h4>Colors</h4>

    <h4>Typography</h4>

    <h4>High-Fidelity</h4>
